            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Engineer with <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2019);</script> years of experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Automation projects. I have expertise in managing the entire Data Science life cycle. Looking forward to working with a team of enthusiastic programmers.</p>
            <p>Throughout my data science journey, I've thrived in tackling challenging problems across various domains. My analytical skills allow me to delve deep into complex datasets, and I leverage machine learning to extract valuable insights and build predictive models.  One area where I've honed my skills is Multiclass Image Classification in CNNs. I've successfully developed solutions using this technique to improve efficiency in image categorization, for example, by automatically classifying images into predefined categories. This streamlines product organization and retrieval processes. Additionally, I've leveraged my expertise in building Expert Support Chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to achieve significant reductions in operational costs through automated customer service interactions. By building chatbots that effectively answer common questions and resolve basic issues, I help companies free up human agents for more complex inquiries. I'm also proficient in Image Extraction and Fraud Detection, continuously seeking opportunities to leverage these skills to reduce operational time and enhance security. I'm currently working on developing models that can reduce operational time by automating data collection tasks (e.g., extracting relevant information from images) and enhance security by identifying suspicious transactions, and minimizing financial losses.</p>
            <p>I am a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to continuously learn and stay abreast of the latest advancements in the ever-evolving field of data science.</p>
